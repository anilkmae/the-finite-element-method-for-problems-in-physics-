Question 1
In the strong form of the problem over the domain (0, 1)(0,1), suppose the forcing function is f = 0f=0. For boundary conditions, suppose that u(0) = 0u(0)=0, and u(1) = 1u(1)=1. What is the polynomial form of the solution, u(x)u(x)?

Linear

Question 2
In the strong form of the problem over the domain (0, 1)(0,1), suppose the forcing function is f = 0f=0 for 0 < x \leq 1/20<x≤1/2; f = 1f=1 for 1/2 < x < 11/2<x<1.  For boundary conditions, suppose that u(0) = 0u(0)=0 and u(1) = 1/8u(1)=1/8. What is the form of u(x)u(x)?



Linear for 0 < x ≤1/2 and quadratic for 1/2 < x <1
