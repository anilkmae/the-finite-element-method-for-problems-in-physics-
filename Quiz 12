Question 1
Consider the Newmark family of time integration algorithms for linear elastodynamics (linear, hyperbolic partial differential equation in a vector
unknown). The damped case is always more stable than the undamped case for any combination of algorithm parameters. 

Ans:True

Question 2
Identify all the conditions for a member of the Newmark family of algorithms to satisfy in order to ensure that the solution will converge with 
respect to refinement of the time step. 

Ans:consistency and stability
