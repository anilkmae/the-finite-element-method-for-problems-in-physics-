Question 1
Consider the constitutive relations for linearized elasticity for an isotropic material and 
suppose that the Poisson ratio = 0=0 for this material. Which of the following is true: 

Ans:there is no coupling between the stress and strain in mutually orthogonal directions


2.
Question 2
In steady state linearized elasticity, you cannot specify the u_1 displacement component as a Dirichlet boundary condition, 
while also specifying the T_2 and T_3 components of the traction as Neumann conditions on that same boundary.

Ans:False

3.
Question 3
Consider two neighboring hexahedral elements in a finite element implementation of steady state linearized elasticity, and 
suppose that they share a common face that does not lie on any of the domain boundaries, nor intersect any of them. When you 
assemble the global stiffness matrix, KK for this problem, how many entries in this matrix will have contributions from both elements? 

Ans:12

Question 4
In linearized elasticity all components of the stress can be specified as a Neumann condition on some boundary. 

Ans:False
