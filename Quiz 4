Ans:k+1


3.
Question 3
Suppose you want to use Gaussian quadrature to exactly integrate the function y(y+2)^4 - y^2 +1 over the domain (−1,1). 
This can be achieved with the following number of quadrature points:

Ans:3


4.
Question 4
You want to numerically integrate a constant function by Gaussian quadrature over the interval (-1,1)(−1,1). The following property allows you to use
any order quadrature:


Ans:the properties in a and b
