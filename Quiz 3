Question 1
What allows us to rewrite the weak form as a matrix-vector product?

Ans:the expansion of the solution u^h and weighting function w^h over a finite-dimensional basis set with degrees of freedom (coefficients)
multiplying each basis function


2.
Question 2
The homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition on the weighting function w^h  , is implemented in the matrix vector weak form by which of these steps?

Ans:setting the corresponding weighting function degree of freedom to zero, or equivalently not using the corresponding basis function in that element


3.
Question 3
True or false: The final, assembled, matrix-vector equation that is to be solved to obtain the finite element solution holds only for one value of 
the weighting function degree of freedom vector.


Ans:False
