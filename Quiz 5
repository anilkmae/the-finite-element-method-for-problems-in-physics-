Question 1
What is the L^2 and H^1 norm of the following function: u(x) = x^2 + 2x, on the interval [0,1][0,1]?


Ans:L^2 norm \sqrt{38/15} , H^1 norm \sqrt{178/15}

Question 2
True or false: The consistency property of the Finite Element Method is a consequence of the fact that the finite-dimensional spaces appearing 
in the finite-dimensional weak form are subsets of the infinite-dimensional spaces appearing in the infinite-dimensional weak form.


Ans:True


3.
Question 3
True or false: The rate of convergence of the finite element error is independent of how smooth (regular) the exact solution is.


Ans:False


4.
Question 4
You have developed a finite element formulation to solve a partial differential equation whose exact solution is infinitely regular (smooth). 
Your finite element implementation uses fourth-order polynomial basis functions. You want to check the rate of convergence of your formulation
in terms of the third spatial derivative of the finite element solution. So you plot the logarithm of the H^3 norm of the error versus the 
logarithm of the reciprocal element size, 1/h1/h (assume that all elements in your implementation have the same size). What is the form of the 
plot you get?



Ans:a line with slope -2
