Question 1
The time-dependent heat conduction problem (linear, parabolic partial differential in a scalar unknown) has a unique solution for temperature even for the case where only flux (Neumann) boundary conditions are applied. When compared with the steady state heat conduction problem, what is it about the time-dependent problem that guarantees a unique solution? 


Ans:the specification of an initial condition on temperature


2.
Question 2
The final finite element equations for time-dependent heat conduction are ordinary differential equations in time. This is a consequence of the following property of the finite-dimensional trial solution: 


Ans:it is separable in the sense that the nodal degrees of freedom are only functions of time, whereas the spatial dependence is 
carried in the basis functions




3.
Question 3
Consider the Euler family of integration algorithms for the time-dependent heat conduction problem (linear, parabolic partial differential in a scalar unknown). What is the amplification factor for high-order modes with the parameter alpha = 0.75=0.75? 


Ans:−1/3


4.
Question 4
Of the Euler family of time integration algorithms for the time-dependent heat conduction problem (linear, parabolic partial differential 
in a scalar unknown), only the Midpoint Rule is second-order accurate. It also is unconditionally stable. However, it does have a drawback:


Ans:high-order modes show oscillations
