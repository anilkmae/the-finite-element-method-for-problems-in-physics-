Question 1
True or false: Suppose a finite dimensional function uh(x)u^h(x)uh(x) is expanded in terms of basis functions NA(x)N^A(x)NA(x), 
where A=1,...,nA = 1,...,nA=1,...,n. Now suppose that uh(x)u^h(x)uh(x) is a numerical solution of some partial differential equation. 
Then, uh(x)u^h(x)uh(x) can, under certain conditions, coincide with the exact solution of the partial differential equation.

Ans:True

Question 3
Consider a partition of the domain (0,L)(0,L)(0,L) into neln_{el}nel​ elements for which the weak form is written as an integral over (0,L)(0,L)(0,L). How many sub-integrals can the weak form be broken up into?

Ans:nel
